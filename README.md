### üìê Project Description 
This project involves developing a web application for a travel agency using Django. The app will provide users with the ability to browse, book, and pay for various travel packages. Additionally, the application will send email confirmations, generate PDF invoices, and offer customer support through an integrated chatbot.
Key features of the application include:
1. **User Booking & Payment:** Users can browse different travel packages, view details, and book their trips through the platform. Payment integration will allow users to pay securely for their bookings.
2. **Email Confirmation:** Upon completing a booking, the system will asynchronously send an email confirmation to the user, leveraging Celery with RabbitMQ as the message broker.
3. **PDF Invoice Generation:** After booking, the system will generate and send a PDF invoice to the user‚Äôs email. This will be done using WeasyPrint library to dynamically generate invoices based on booking details.
4. **Travel News Scraping:** The app will scrape travel news websites using BeautifulSoup tool to gather the latest news and tips. These articles will be stored in the app‚Äôs database for easy access by users.
5. **Personalized Recommendations:** The system will analyze user preferences and feedback, and provide personalized recommendations for packages, activities, or destinations using libraries such as NumPy or SciPy for calculations.

## ‚ú® Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### üöß Prerequisites

You may find below the list of things you need to use this project :
* Python installed on your system.
* RabbitMQ installed and running.
* GTK3 installed to enable WeasyPrint to work properly (for generating PDF files).

### üõ† Installation

_In order to install the app you need to follow the instructions below :_
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ahlem-phantom/django-travel-agency.git
   ```


 #### Project backend :
2. Create a virtual environement and activate it 
   ```sh
   ($) python3 -m venv venv
   ($) .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
   ```  
3. Install flask dependecies using the file "requirements.txt"
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Rename the file .env_template and fill it with your flouci api credentials with your email settings 
```sh
  FLOUCI_APP_TOKEN=your-app-token-here
  FLOUCI_APP_SECRET=your-app-secret-here
  EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your-mail-address-here'
  EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your-mail-password-her'
  DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'your-mail-address-here'
   ```
5. Run Django Migrations 
   ```sh
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py migrate django_celery_results
   ```


6. Create a Superuser Account for Admin Access
   ```sh
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```
You'll be prompted to enter a username, email, and password for the admin account. After the superuser is created, you'll be able to log in to the Django admin dashboard.

7. Run the django server
   ```sh
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

8. Open localhost:8000 to enjoy the app.

   
#### Celery Setup :

9. Start RabbitMQ (ensure RabbitMQ is installed and running)
   ```sh
   rabbitmq-server 
   ```
10. Enable RabbitMQ Management Plugin:
  ```sh
  rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
  ```
This will enable the web interface at http://localhost:15672. You can log in using the default credentials (guest as both the username and password).

11. Start the Celery worker
   ```sh
   celery -A django_travel_agency worker --loglevel=info
   ```

Proceed to the booking form where you can:
1. Select the number of adults and children.
2. Enjoy dynamic pricing: Children receive a 50% discount, and the total price updates in real-time based on your selection.
3. Choose your preferred payment method: Pay online or on-site for added flexibility.

| ------------- |

Once the online payment is picked, a payment URL will be generated, redirecting you to the payment page. To simulate a successful transaction, enter "111111" and you will be redirected to the success page. For a failed payment, use "0000000" to be redirected to the failure page.

I started this but didn't have time to finish it all. I created an assistant to guide users through the booking process and gather user feedback, but time was short. I also built a recommendation system, but it's not strong enough as it relies on ratings that I personally added to the database for each travel package and user gender. It lacks user data like feedback and preferences.
